# TrustSource-Ant-Plugin
TrustSource (https://www.trustsource.io) is a legal resolver and OpenChain compliant workflow engine that allows you to manage your open source dependencies, provide legal compliance and create bill of materials.

The Ant plugin provides TrustSource integration with Apache Ant/Ivy. It uses the [TrustSource Java client](https://github.com/eacg-gmbh/ecs-java-client/) to transfer Ivy based dependency information to TrustSource-Server via its REST-API. 

There are also several other plugins available to integrate with different build tools.
